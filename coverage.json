Replace them with a single X (Twitter) Communities card linking to https://x.com/i/communities/2027059335088521312. The card should follow the same bold social card style as the existing cards. Update any CTA copy or descriptive text accordingly so there are no remaining references to Discord or Telegram in the section.",
