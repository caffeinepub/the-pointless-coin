# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a fully static, single-page meme coin website for "The Pointless Coin" — a humorous, high-energy crypto landing page inspired by theuselesscoin.com layout and structure.

**Planned changes:**
- Sticky navigation bar with coin logo, name, and anchor links (About, Tokenomics, How to Buy, Roadmap, Community)
- Full-viewport hero section with animated coin image, "THE POINTLESS COIN" headline, meme tagline, and "Buy Now" / "Join Community" CTA buttons
- About section with humorous, self-aware meme-coin copy and coin image
- Tokenomics section displaying at least 4 stats (supply, tax, liquidity lock, etc.) in bold cards with ironic labels
- How to Buy section with 4 numbered steps, icons, and beginner-friendly humorous copy
- Satirical Roadmap section with 4 phases (Phase 1: Launch, Phase 2: Go up, Phase 3: We figure it out, Phase 4: Moon?)
- Community section with large social cards linking to X/Twitter, Telegram, and Discord (placeholder hrefs)
- Footer with coin name, meme coin disclaimer, copyright, and social links
- Bold visual theme: deep black background, gold/yellow accents, chunky display fonts, glow/neon effects, coin spin/float animation, button hover glow
- Coin image (`pointless-coin.dim_512x512.png`) used in hero, nav logo, and about section

**User-visible outcome:** Users can view a fully styled, single-page meme coin marketing site for The Pointless Coin with all sections, animations, and social links in place.
