# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove all "Liquidity Locked" references from every component across the site.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove every instance of "Liquidity Locked", "liquidity locked", "liq locked", or equivalent phrasing from TokenomicsSection, TickerBanner, HeroSection, AboutSection, HowToBuySection, Navigation, CommunitySection, Footer, and any other components containing such text
- Ensure affected layouts reflow cleanly without the removed elements, leaving no visual gaps or broken grids

**User-visible outcome:** No mention of "Liquidity Locked" appears anywhere on the site, and all sections display cleanly without that text.
