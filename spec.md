# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the contract address display from Step 2 in the HowToBuySection component.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the contract address text (and any associated label or copy button) shown under Step 2 ("Swap SOL for $POINTLESS on Phantom") in the HowToBuySection
- Leave all other content in Step 2 (title, description, icon) unchanged
- Leave Steps 1 and 3 unchanged

**User-visible outcome:** Step 2 in the How To Buy section no longer shows the contract address beneath it.
