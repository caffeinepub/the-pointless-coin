# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove Discord and Telegram from the Community section and replace them with a single X Communities card.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the Discord card from the CommunitySection component
- Remove the Telegram card from the CommunitySection component
- Add a single X Communities card linking to https://x.com/i/communities/2027059335088521312, styled consistently with the existing bold social card style
- Update any CTA or descriptive text in the section to remove references to Discord and Telegram
- Remove Discord and Telegram icons from the Footer social links, retaining only the X link

**User-visible outcome:** The Community section displays only one social card — X Communities — with no Discord or Telegram options visible anywhere on the page.
