  "summary": "The diff addresses REQ-23 by removing '0% TAX' entries from the TickerBanner marquee and removing the tax-related card from TokenomicsSection. The file summaries confirm these removals. No replacement tax copy was introduced. The changes appear to cleanly satisfy the core requirement across the audited components.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-23",
      "requirement": "Audit ALL frontend components including HeroSection, AboutSection, HowToBuySection, Navigation, CommunitySection, Footer for any 0% tax references and remove them.",
      "reason": "The diff only shows direct code changes to TickerBanner.tsx. The TokenomicsSection, HeroSection, AboutSection, HowToBuySection, Navigation, CommunitySection, and Footer changes are only referenced via the frontend-file-summaries.txt descriptions, not via actual diff hunks. Without seeing the actual code diffs for those files, it cannot be fully verified that all tax references were removed from every component.",
