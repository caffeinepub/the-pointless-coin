  "summary": "The diff implements a comprehensive meme coin website with all major sections, visual theme, and coin image integration. All 10 requirements appear to be substantially implemented. The hero coin uses a float/bob animation (animate-coin-float) which satisfies the AC allowing 'spin or float'. The coin image path in components uses '/assets/generated/pointless-coin.dim_512x512.png' matching the requirement. A TickerBanner component was added which was not requested. The main.tsx wraps the app in InternetIdentityProvider which relates to auth — a stated non-goal — but appears to be framework scaffold boilerplate.",
