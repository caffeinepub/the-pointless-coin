  "summary": "The diff shows that HowToBuySection.tsx has been modified to remove the contract address from Step 2. The updated component's Step 2 object contains no contract address string, CA label, or copy-button. The file summary for HowToBuySection.tsx explicitly states 'contract address removed' for Step 2. Steps 1 and 3 appear unchanged. The heading, description, and icon for Step 2 remain intact. REQ-25 appears to be fully implemented.",
